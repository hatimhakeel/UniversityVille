UniversityVille
===============

ASP.NET MVC Project built on top of the Contoso University sample (EF 5 version)

This is a demo and test project used to apply new technologies learnt in developing ASP.NET MVC based web applications.

Initial Technologies

1. ASP.NET MVC 
2. Entity Framework (Code first migrations were used.)
3. SQL Server Local Db

Road Map for future
===================

1. Apply an IoC container for DI
2. Include a unit test project with mock objects (Technology needs to be researched.)
3. Enhance the domain model by adding more entities and interactions, covering a larger number of real world scenarios
4. Add authentication with role priviledges
5. Research on related software design patterns to increase code and architectural quality

* The current version is in repoUoW branch and not yet merged to master.
